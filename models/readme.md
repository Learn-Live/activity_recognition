# classical
- classical machine learning models to obtain the preliminary results

# cnn_bert 
-  one potential model for activity recognition
    1. python   ==  3.7.9
    2. install all the libraries in the requirement.txt
    3. download datasets (e.g, hmdb51) and weights (from https://onedrive.live.com/?authkey=%21ACfd54VbdRBn6qM&id=463D936354E78FA2%21107&cid=463D936354E78FA2)
    4. run the code (e.g., two_stream_bert2.py)
